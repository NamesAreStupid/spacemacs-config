# spacemacs-config

Create a ~/.spacemacs.d folder and put the file in there.

## Windows instructions:

To clone this spacemacs config to the appropriate location execute the following:
```
cd %userprofile%/AppData/Roaming
git clone https://github.com/NamesAreStupid/spacemacs-config.git .spacemacs.d
```

## Known Errors:
When updating the Spacemacs version a preexisting .spacemacs.env file can cause errors, eg. pointing to the wrong emacs directory. In that case just delete the .spacemacs.env file.
